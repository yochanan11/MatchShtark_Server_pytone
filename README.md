## üéØ Project Background & Evolution

### üîπ Initial Vision: Academic Guidance Assistant

The original idea behind this project was to build a **machine-learning-powered academic advisor**.
We aimed to help students choose their study path based on personalized factors such as previous education, interests, capabilities, and real-world success data. The idea was to automate and optimize the role of a human advisor through data analysis and pattern recognition.

### üîÑ Pivot: Matchmaking System for the Haredi Community

After consulting with our academic supervisor, the project evolved into a **more socially impactful and technically challenging task**:

> Building a smart matchmaking system tailored for the **Haredi (ultra-Orthodox Jewish) community**.

This pivot preserved the same core logic ‚Äî matching between two entities (student-course or boy-girl) based on past success patterns ‚Äî but it required much **deeper adaptation** in terms of culture, data structure, and interface.

It was important to respect privacy, cultural norms, and work with often limited or inconsistent data. The system is now designed to **learn from successful matches**, analyze patterns, and propose high-quality candidate matches to matchmakers.

üí° **Note:** Although the project became a matchmaking system, it remains **fully adaptable** to the original educational advisor idea ‚Äî or even other use cases like recruitment or role assignments ‚Äî by simply changing the input data and matching criteria.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technology Stack & Key Design Decisions

### üõ†Ô∏è Initial Plan: Node.js + Python

At first, we planned to use:

* **Node.js** for the backend API
* **Python** for the machine learning model
  This architecture is common, but it required **running two servers simultaneously**, managing cross-language communication, and synchronizing model output with HTTP requests ‚Äî which led to complexity and maintenance overhead.

### üîÅ Rethinking the Architecture

We quickly realized that the operational cost and technical overhead were unjustified for our needs.
As a result, we made a key strategic decision:

> ‚úÖ **Unify the entire backend using Flask (Python)**, so that both the API and the machine learning model live in the same environment.

### ‚úÖ Benefits of the Flask-based Approach

* **Fast Response Time** ‚Äî under 2 seconds even under moderate load
* **Simpler Deployment** ‚Äî no need for two separate servers
* **Single Language Backend** ‚Äî easier to maintain and expand
* **Direct Integration** ‚Äî the ML model runs natively inside the same codebase as the REST API
* **Easy Customization** ‚Äî swapping datasets allows the system to be reused in other domains

## üß† Machine Learning Details

* **Model Used:** `XGBoost` classifier, trained on real historical match data
* **Feature Engineering:**  Structured comparison of family, lifestyle, education, and social preferences
* **Evaluation:** GridSearchCV for parameter tuning, `SHAP` for feature importance visualization
* **Balance Handling:** SMOTE applied to balance the dataset
* **Top-N Predictions:** System ranks top 5 best match candidates using probability scoring

## üß© Flexible & Reusable Architecture

The MatchShtark platform is **not limited to matchmaking**. It can easily be adapted to:

* Academic program recommendations
* Career or job matching
* Volunteer-role fit
* Medical compatibility suggestion systems

By changing the data and fine-tuning the model, you can **reuse the same architecture** across multiple domains.
